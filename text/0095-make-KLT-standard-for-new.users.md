# Make Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit the standard for new users

The Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit (KLT) is the next step after Keptn V 1.x. It is more flexible, better integrated into Kubernetes and also more lightweight and extensible. Therefore, we should direct new users to start their journey with the lifecycle toolkit right away.

## Motivation

* New users get started on the latest version of Keptn
* New extensions/services will also be built in a future-proof way
* These users will not have to migrate later
* We reduce confusion between the lifecycle toolkit and Keptn V 1.x
* This will allow us to focus any new developments on the lifecycle toolkit

## Explanation

* We rework the website to be better aligned with the lifecycle toolkit.
* All onboarding flows will be directed towards the lifecycle toolkit and lifecycle toolkit docs. 
* The current Keptn V1.x documentation will still be available but under a dedicated menu item.
* All V1.x resources will have a banner stating "If you are new to Keptn we recommend starting with the lifecycle toolkit"

## Internal details


## Trade-offs and mitigations

* Existing users might be confused when coming to the Keptn website. *Mitigation* we have been informing everybody about our plans since last fall

## Breaking changes

This is a breaking change, how we onboard users.

## Prior art and alternatives

We were discussing alternatives on whether providing different onboarding paths. However, all approaches resulted in more complexity for the user. 

## Open questions

The main question that is not resolved is how we migrate existing users over to the lifecycle toolkit. As this is a bigger discussion that is also separate it should be discussed in a separate KEP.
